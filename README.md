# derpcalc
derpcalc- the multipurpose scientific calculator app

This is a QT Creator project, and to build it, you will need qmake (or qt creator).
You will also need to install the `ncurses` and `mpfr` libraries using your package manager.

This project uses parts of the boost library collection, including -

* Boost::varient
* Boost::unordered_map
* Boost::function

The lates version of the Boost library collection can be downloaded from [here](http://boost.org).

This project uses the mpfr::real library by Christian Schneider licensed under the GNU GPL v3.

Currently, this application is impossibe to build. I am working on fixing this, though.
