# derpcalc
derpcalc- the multipurpose scientific calculator app

This is a QT Creator project, and to build it, you will need qmake.
You will also need to put the ncurses library shared object files and headers into their respective subfolders.

This project uses parts of the boost library collection, including -

* Boost::varient
* Boost::unordered_map
* Boost::function

The lates version of the Boost library collection can be downloaded from [here](http://boost.org).

Currently, this application is impossibe to build. I am working on fixing this, though.
